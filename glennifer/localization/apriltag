/**
 * @file april_tags.cpp
 * @brief Example application for April tags library
 * @author: Michael Kaess
 *
 * Opens the first available camera (typically a built in camera in a
 * laptop) and continuously detects April tags in the incoming
 * images. Detections are both visualized in the live image and shown
 * in the text console. Optionally allows selecting of a specific
 * camera in case multiple ones are present and specifying image
 * resolution as long as supported by the camera. Also includes the
 * option to send tag detections via a serial port, for example when
 * running on a Raspberry Pi that is connected to an Arduino.
